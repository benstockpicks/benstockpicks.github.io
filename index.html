<header class="he1">Ben's Stock Picks</header>

<p class="p2">
  This is not advice. The picks are from some research that I have been doing. 
  I want to get really good at this. I want to have a record of the picks 
  and you can be my witness. Earlier in my research I found numerous <br>
  "Homeruns" stocks that were priced as low as $5 and ran as high as $40. My most 
  recent experience was TKAT. I panic sold when it dropped 5% only for it to rise $26 
  more afterwards. Below I will show my Portfolio list and tell which stocks  
  that I will keep long term (possibly forever), short term (up to a month) and 
  daily/weekly picks. There will be more picks to come. Now let's get to it.
</p>

<h3 class="he2">My Pick Of The Day</h3>
<p class="p1">
  HOME 33.08 <br>
  This is my pick of the day. It has to the potential to have a good gain short or <br>
  long term. In a years time it has increased from $2 to $33 and I am expecting it <br>
  set another 52 week high this week. It has been a consistent gainer over the year <br>
  so with that being said it could go south real fast.
</p>

<h3 class="he2">My Portfolio</h3>
<P class="p1">
  1. GME  199.00<br>
  2. RBLX  70.10 <br>
  3. DSP   52.00<br>
  4. CPNG  45.02<br>
  5. HOME  33.15<br>
  6. ZIM   28.70<br>
  7. AMC   13.59<br>
  8. SNCA   1.64<br>
  9. JUVAF  0.86<br>
This is my portfolio as of 3-21-2021. My long term picks are GME, RBLX, CPNG and AMC.  <br>
My short term is HOME and the others are daily/weekly with ZIM having the most potential. <br>
There are a few long term investments such as VZIO and SEMR that are coming later this week <br>
that I may add if the IPO is right. The the last two long term stocks that I planned to add for the first half <br>
the year will be APP and COIN. Then after 6 months I will reassess and make a decision on whether I should <br>
keep them all or sell and replace. GME so far has been my biggest earner.<br>
</p>

<h3 class="he2">Monday's Picks</h3>
<p class="p2">
  1. OTCM 40.00<br>
  2. TSLX 22.31<br>
  3. GTY  28.69 <br>
  4. JEF  33.74<br>
  These are my picks for Monday 3-21-2021. The research tells that the above stocks have the <br>
  have the potential to grow at a fast pace and then decline just as fast so I will have to set a <br>
  stop loss point. My favorite of the four is JEF.
</p>

<h3 class="he2">Monday's Watch List</h3>
<p class="p1">
  1. BCRX 13.24<br>
  2. PCRX 70.06<br>
  3. SPRB 17.45<br>
  4. PRQR  5.64<br>
  5. DVAX 10.03<br>
  6. KNSA 20.14<br>
  7. AXTI 13.11<br>
  The above stocks should increase over the week and could later become a pick. There are <br>
  some events that are coming up that could increase their values. I'm kind of<br>
  excited to see the outcome. They are all nice in their own way but PCRX and BCRX are my <br>
  favorites out of this bunch.<br>
</p>

<h3 class="he2">These Are My Gem Picks</h3>
<p class="p1">
  1. MNKKQ 0.36<br>
  2. LPTX  2.46<br>
  The above stocks are stocks are my long shots. I'm hoping to buy cheap and they blow up <br>
  one day. I have my eyes on some others but as of now I'm going with these.
</p>

<h3 class="he2">Extra Thought</h3>
<p class="p1">
  As for my daily stock, I have a few sites that I watch to keep track of the stocks that are <br>
  rising at a fast or decent pace and the increase is constent or consistent and I jump on it and <br>
  "ride it 'til the wheels fall off". It's been a lot of times where I was looking too long and <br>
  and miss the ride. This week I will try to do a much better on that and I will keep you posted <br>
  on what those picks were and if it a good or bad experience.
